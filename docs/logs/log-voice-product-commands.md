# Voice-Controlled Product Management Feature

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Gemini API Key (Required)

1. Visit **https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey**
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the generated key (starts with `AIza...`)

### 2. Add API Key to Environment

Open `.env.local` and replace the placeholder:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...your_actual_key_here
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both:
- Next.js frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Convex backend: Opens dashboard automatically

### 4. Test the Feature

Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/voice-demo**

## What Was Implemented

### Complete Voice Command System

- **Voice Input Processing**: Capture audio from microphone using Web Audio API
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Natural language understanding with function calling
- **Real-time Database**: Convex mutations and queries with instant UI updates
- **User Authentication**: Clerk integration for secure user-scoped data
- **Analytics Logging**: Track all voice commands for accuracy analysis

### Key Features

1. **Single Product Commands**
   - "Save product 3"
   - "Remove item 5"

2. **Batch Operations**
   - "Save products 1, 2, and 3"
   - "Remove items 4 and 5"

3. **Confidence Validation**
   - 70% confidence threshold
   - Prompts user to repeat unclear commands

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Saved products list updates instantly
   - No page refresh needed

5. **Test Mode**
   - Text-based command testing
   - No microphone required

## Files Created

### Backend (Convex)
- `/convex/products.ts` - Product save/remove mutations
- `/convex/voiceCommands.ts` - Command logging and analytics
- `/convex/schema.ts` - Database tables (savedProducts, voiceCommands)

### Frontend Library
- `/lib/gemini.ts` - Gemini API integration with function calling

### React Hooks
- `/hooks/useVoiceCommands.ts` - Web Audio API integration
- `/hooks/useSavedProducts.ts` - Convex mutations wrapper
- `/hooks/useVoiceProductCommands.ts` - Voice + product integration

### UI Components
- `/components/VoiceProductManager.tsx` - Main voice interface
- `/components/SavedProductsList.tsx` - Real-time saved products display

### Pages
- `/app/voice-demo/page.tsx` - Demo page with authentication

### Documentation
- `.claude/plans/VOICE_PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `.claude/plans/VOICE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation details

## How It Works

### Voice Command Flow

1. **User clicks microphone button** → Starts recording
2. **User speaks command** → "save product 3"
3. **User clicks button again** → Stops recording
4. **Audio sent to Gemini API** → Extracts structured data
5. **Confidence check** → Must be ≥ 70%
6. **Database mutation** → Saves/removes product
7. **Real-time UI update** → List updates instantly
8. **Success message** → Confirms action

### Architecture

```
User Voice Input
    ↓
Web Audio API (MediaRecorder)
    ↓
Audio Blob → Gemini API
    ↓
Function Calling Extraction
    {action: "save", productNumbers: [3], confidence: 0.95}
    ↓
Convex Mutation (saveProduct)
    ↓
Real-time Subscription Update
    ↓
UI Updates Instantly
```

## Usage Examples

### Voice Commands

**Save single product:**
```
"Save product 3"
"Add item 5"
"Save number 2"
```

**Remove single product:**
```
"Remove product 4"
"Delete item 1"
"Remove number 6"
```

**Batch save:**
```
"Save products 1, 2, and 3"
"Save 1, 2, and 3"
"Add items 4, 5, and 6"
```

**Batch remove:**
```
"Remove products 2 and 3"
"Remove 1, 4, and 5"
"Delete items 2, 3, and 6"
```

### Test Mode (No Microphone)

1. Click "Show Test Mode" at bottom of voice manager
2. Type: `save product 3`
3. Click "Test"
4. View result

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured"
**Solution:** Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local` and restart server

### Error: "Microphone access denied"
**Solution:**
1. Click the lock icon in browser address bar
2. Allow microphone access for localhost
3. Refresh page and try again

### "Low confidence" messages frequently
**Solution:**
- Speak more clearly and slowly
- Reduce background noise
- Move closer to microphone
- Use test mode to verify command format works

### Products not updating
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're signed in with Clerk
- Check Convex dashboard for mutation logs
- Refresh page to reconnect

## Browser Support

### Supported Browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (with microphone permissions)

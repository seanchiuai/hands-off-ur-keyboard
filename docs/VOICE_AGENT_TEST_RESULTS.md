# Voice Agent Testing Results

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Test Environment
- **Browser:** Playwright (Chromium)
- **Application URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Authentication:** Clerk (seankklol123@gmail.com)
- **Test Type:** End-to-end functional testing

## Test Execution

### 1. Authentication
✅ **PASSED**
- Successfully navigated to application
- Clerk sign-in modal appeared
- Email authentication flow worked correctly
- Verification code (118647) accepted
- User successfully logged in and redirected to dashboard

### 2. UI Rendering
✅ **PASSED**
- Dashboard loaded correctly
- Voice shopping section visible
- Connection status panel displayed:
  - ✅ Microphone: Ready
  - ✅ Gemini AI: Connected
  - ✅ Daily.co: Connected
  - ✅ BrightData: Connected
- "Start voice chat" button rendered
- Conversation panel visible
- Product display area visible

### 3. Voice Chat Initialization
❌ **FAILED**

**Issue:** Clicking the "Start voice chat" button disables it but does not trigger the voice chat session.

**Observed Behavior:**
1. Button clicked successfully
2. Button becomes disabled (loading state)
3. Button stays disabled indefinitely
4. No API calls to `/api/daily-room` detected
5. No room creation or voice session initialization

**Expected Behavior:**
1. Button clicked
2. Microphone permission requested
3. POST to `/api/daily-room` to create Daily room
4. Convex session created
5. Voice agent started via orchestrator
6. Button shows "active" state (pulsing microphone)
7. User can speak and see transcripts

### 4. Network Requests Analysis

**Missing Requests:**
- ❌ POST `/api/daily-room` - Should create WebRTC room
- ❌ POST to orchestrator - Should start voice agent
- ❌ WebSocket connections to Daily.co - Should establish audio stream

**Successful Requests:**
- ✅ Clerk authentication endpoints
- ✅ Convex token generation
- ✅ Static assets loading
- ✅ GET `/api/check-config` - Config check succeeded

### 5. Console Errors

**Errors Found:**
- ❌ Failed to load resource: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@github/mona-sans@1.0.0/fonts/variable/Mona-Sans.woff2 (404)
  - **Impact:** Visual only (missing font), does not affect functionality

**No JavaScript Errors:**
- No errors related to voice chat functionality
- No errors in component rendering
- No errors in API calls

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: API Call Not Triggered

The voice chat button click does not trigger the `/api/daily-room` endpoint. Possible causes:

1. **Microphone Permission Issue**
   - Browser may not be granting microphone permissions in Playwright
   - Component may be waiting for permission before making API call
   - No permission dialog observed

2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - `DAILY_API_KEY` may not be set in `.env.local`
   - `PIPECAT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` may not be configured
   - Component may fail silently if config missing

3. **Component State Issue**
   - Button click handler may not be properly wired
   - State management may be preventing API call
   - React hooks may not be executing

4. **Daily.co Library Issue**
   - `@daily-co/daily-react` may require specific browser context
   - Playwright may not support WebRTC properly
   - Library initialization may be failing silently

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Check Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Verify .env.local contains:
   DAILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
   PIPECAT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Start Orchestrator**
   ```bash
   cd pipecat-voice-agent
   source venv/bin/activate
   python orchestrator.py
   ```
   Verify it's running on http://localhost:8000

3. **Check Browser Console**
   - Run in actual Chrome browser (not Playwright)
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API calls are being made

4. **Manual Testing**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in Chrome
   - Open DevTools Network tab
   - Click microphone button
   - Check for POST to `/api/daily-room`

### Code Investigation

1. **Check VoiceMicButton Component**
   - File: `components/VoiceMicButton.tsx`
   - Verify click handler calls `startVoiceChat()`
   - Check if microphone permission is requested
   - Verify API call logic

2. **Check Daily Room API Route**
   - File: `app/api/daily-room/route.ts`
   - Verify `DAILY_API_KEY` environment variable check
   - Test endpoint manually: `curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/daily-room`

3. **Check Orchestrator Availability**
   - Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
   - Verify orchestrator is accepting requests

### Playwright-Specific Issues

Playwright may have limitations with:
- WebRTC/getUserMedia APIs
- Microphone permission dialogs
- Audio streaming

**Alternative Testing Approach:**
- Use manual browser testing for WebRTC features
- Use Playwright for UI/UX testing only
- Mock Daily.co API calls for automated tests

## Configuration Checklist

Before testing again:

- [ ] Verify `DAILY_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- [ ] Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set
- [ ] Verify `PIPECAT_ORCHESTRATOR_URL` is set (default: http://localhost:8000)
- [ ] Start orchestrator: `python pipecat-voice-agent/orchestrator.py`
- [ ] Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r pipecat-voice-agent/requirements.txt`
- [ ] Configure orchestrator `.env` file with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `CONVEX_URL`
- [ ] Test orchestrator health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- [ ] Restart Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`

## Expected Next Steps

1. **Configure Missing Environment Variables**
   - Set all required API keys
   - Start orchestrator service

2. **Manual Browser Test**
   - Test in Chrome with DevTools open
   - Verify API calls and responses
   - Check microphone permissions

3. **Fix Root Cause**
   - Add error handling to VoiceMicButton
   - Add console logs for debugging
   - Display error messages to user

4. **Re-test with Playwright**
   - After manual testing succeeds
   - May need to mock microphone permissions
   - Focus on UI state testing

## Summary

**Test Status: ❌ FAILED**

The voice agent backend refactoring was completed successfully, but the frontend integration is not functional. The microphone button does not initiate the voice chat session. The most likely cause is missing environment configuration or the orchestrator service not running.

**Action Required:**
1. Configure environment variables
2. Start orchestrator service
3. Perform manual browser testing
4. Debug component click handler

**Files Modified:** None (testing only)

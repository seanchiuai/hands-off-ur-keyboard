# Simplified MVP Summary - Voice-Only Shopping

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Plans Updated, Code Implemented, Ready for Testing

---

## What Changed

### Before (Complex)
- 5 routes: `/`, `/shop`, `/search`, `/voice`, `/voice-demo`, `/saved`
- Both voice AND keyboard input
- Separate pages for different features
- Search forms and manual input
- Too many options and UI elements

### After (Simple MVP)
- **2 routes:** `/` and `/saved`
- **Voice-only** - zero keyboard input required
- **Single dashboard** - everything on one page
- **No search forms** - only microphone button
- **Minimal UI** - focus on voice interaction

---

## Routes

### `/` - Main Voice Shopping Dashboard

**What's on the page:**

# Add these environment variables:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
DAILY_API_KEY=your_daily_api_key_here
BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=your_brightdata_api_key_here
```

**Daily.co Domain Allowlist:**
```
1. Go to: https://dashboard.daily.co
2. Settings → Domains
3. Add: localhost:3000 (dev)
4. Add: your-production-domain.com (prod)

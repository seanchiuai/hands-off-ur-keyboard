# Convex + Clerk + Next.js Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your own Convex backend and Clerk authentication for this Next.js application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- A Clerk account (free)
- A Convex account (free)

## Step 1: Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd vibed-starter-web

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 2: Set Up Clerk

1. **Create a Clerk Account**
   - Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up
   - Create a new application
   - Choose "Next.js" as your framework

2. **Get Your Clerk Keys**
   - In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **API Keys**
   - Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)

3. **Configure JWT Template in Clerk**

   **This is critical for Clerk to work with Convex:**

   - In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **JWT Templates** in the sidebar
   - Click **New Template** and select **Convex**
   - Name it exactly `convex` (lowercase, this exact name is important)
   - Set the **Issuer** to your Clerk domain (e.g., `https://your-app.clerk.accounts.dev`)
   - Save the template

4. **Get Your Clerk Domain**
   - In your Clerk Dashboard, go to **API Keys**
   - Note your Frontend API URL (e.g., `https://your-app.clerk.accounts.dev`)
   - You'll need this for Step 4

## Step 3: Initialize Convex

1. **Create a Convex Account**
   - Go to [convex.dev](https://convex.dev) and sign up
   - Create a new project

2. **Initialize Convex in Your Project**

   **Important: You must run this command yourself in your terminal** (not through an AI agent) as it's an interactive setup:

   ```bash
   npx convex dev
   ```
   - When prompted, select "Create a new project"
   - Enter your project name
   - This will create a `.env.local` file with your Convex deployment URL
   - Copy the deployment URL (it looks like `https://your-project.convex.cloud`)

## Step 4: Configure Convex Authentication

Now that Convex is initialized, configure it to work with Clerk:

1. **Add Clerk JWT Issuer Domain**
   - In your Convex Dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
   - Add a new variable:
     - Name: `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN`
     - Value: Your Clerk Frontend API URL (from Step 2.4)

2. **Update Convex Auth Config**

   Update `convex/auth.config.ts` with your Clerk domain:

   ```typescript
   export default {
     providers: [
       {
         domain: "https://your-app.clerk.accounts.dev", // Replace with your domain
         applicationID: "convex",
       },
     ]
   };
   ```

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Create or update `.env.local` file** in the root directory with your credentials:

   ```env
   # Convex Configuration (auto-populated by npx convex dev)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud

   # Clerk Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_key_here
   ```

   **Where to find these:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`: Auto-populated from Step 3, or copy from Convex Dashboard
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk Dashboard â†’ API Keys â†’ Publishable key
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Clerk Dashboard â†’ API Keys â†’ Secret key

   **Note for AI Agent Users**: If you're working with an AI agent (like Claude Code), you can paste your Clerk keys directly in the chat, and the agent will create or update the `.env.local` file for you. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` should already be populated from Step 3.

2. **Verify your setup**:
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in your `.gitignore` (it should be by default)
   - Never commit your actual keys to version control

## Step 6: Run the Application

**Important: You must run this command yourself in your terminal** (not through an AI agent):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- Next.js frontend at `http://localhost:3000`
- Convex backend (dashboard opens automatically)

### Alternative: Run Services Individually

```bash
# Frontend only
npm run dev:frontend

# Backend only
npm run dev:backend
```

## Step 7: Test the Integration

1. **Sign Up Flow**
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - You'll see the Clerk sign-in component
   - Click "Sign up" to create a new account
   - Enter your email and password
   - Check your email for the verification code
   - Enter the code to complete signup

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - After signing in, you should be authenticated
   - The app will have access to your user session
   - Protected routes (e.g., `/server/*`) will be accessible

3. **Real-time Database**
   - Any Convex queries and mutations will work with your authenticated session
   - Check the Convex dashboard to see real-time function calls and data

4. **Sign Out**
   - Use the Clerk `<UserButton />` component or sign out functionality
   - You'll be redirected to the sign-in screen

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Clerk Publishable Key" Error
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart the Next.js dev server after adding environment variables

### "Convex client not configured" Error
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is set correctly in `.env.local`
- Check that your Convex dev server is running: `npm run dev:backend`
- Verify your internet connection

### Authentication Not Working
- Verify the JWT template in Clerk is named exactly "convex"
- Check that `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` is set in Convex Dashboard environment variables
- Ensure `convex/auth.config.ts` has the correct domain
- Check that you're using the correct Clerk publishable key and secret key

### Build Errors
- Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Clear the `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next` and rebuild

### Middleware Issues
- Check `middleware.ts` configuration
- Ensure protected routes are properly configured
- Verify Clerk middleware is correctly set up

## Production Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository

3. **Add Environment Variables**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
   - Add all variables from your `.env.local`:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
     - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`

4. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to main
   - Your app will be live at `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Deploy Convex

1. **Configure Auto-Deploy**
   - In Convex Dashboard, go to **Settings** â†’ **Deploy Settings**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Convex will automatically deploy when you push to main

2. **Manual Deploy**
   ```bash
   npx convex deploy --prod
   ```

### Production Environment Variables

For production:
- Use production Clerk keys (not `_test_` keys)
- Use production Convex deployment URL
- Set up proper environment management in Vercel

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable appropriate auth rules in Convex functions
- [ ] Configure allowed domains in Clerk dashboard
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies if needed
- [ ] Review middleware route protection
- [ ] Enable rate limiting if needed
